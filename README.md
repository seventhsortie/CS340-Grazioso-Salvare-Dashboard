# Writing Maintainable, Readable and Adaptable Code

The CRUD Python module from Project One exemplifies maintainable, readable, and adaptable coding. Centralising database operations enhances maintainability, allowing for streamlined updates and management. The clear function naming improves readability, making it easier to understand the purpose of the code. The module's abstraction level ensures adaptability, facilitating backend changes without impacting the main application.

Some advantages of this approach include reusability. This is evident in its application in Project Two. It also promotes scalability, allowing for future expansion. This module can be reused or serve as a template for other database-related projects, demonstrating its versatility.

# Problem-Solving in the Grazioso Salvare project

For the Grazioso Salvare project, my approach involved understanding client requirements, adopting a modular design and iterative development. This project may differ from previous assignments in its direct application of theory to practical scenarios and required integration of diverse technologies. Future database projects would benefit from a focus on scalability, and security measures. It was a challenging run as even though the previous assignments were a build-up towards this, I still had to think through the front-end much more to make sure that my app did not look like it was completely unusable. I would probably also not use the standard pie chart layout - it needs more personalisation.

#  What role do Computer Scientists play?

In the context of the Grazioso Salvare project, my role was to automate tasks and analyse data, enabling the company to make data-driven decisions. In this case, the project helped the company to deploy dogs for training where they would excel. The impact of this is likely profound - saving many animals from potential euthanasia or homelessness, and giving them a chance to assist us in making the world a better place. The creation of this dashboard demonstrates how critical computer science is in the world that we live in today, turning data into actionable insights.
